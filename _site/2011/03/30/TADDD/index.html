    <h1>Test and Design Driven Development</h1>
    <p>For quite some time the way I&#8217;ve worked was to develop the application as if the interface didn&#8217;t matter, until it was done. Write my features, tests, etc and then when you have a functioning 1.0, slap some pretty on it. It always felt wrong, it felt unfair to the application.</p>
<p><a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/10/05/outside-in-development/">Outside-In Development</a> is pretty awesome but while it ends up being great for features and application code, it didn&#8217;t seem right for mixing in some design work. I&#8217;ve altered the my general, outside-in, workflow to include some design time. Here&#8217;s how it goes..</p>
<h3>Cucumber</h3>
<p>Write a feature; keep it high level and based on value (you already know this though). Lets say you&#8217;re working on the Authentication portion of your application. You want to make sure when a user signs in, they are greeted with the message &#8220;Hey there!&#8221;.</p>
<h3>RSpec, MiniTest, etc.</h3>
<p>Write some controller and model tests to get rolling with the lower level login stuff. Let&#8217;s pretend you just did that. A user can sign in and they will in fact see &#8220;Hey there!&#8221;. That&#8217;s awesome, nice work. Except&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="/public/images/taddd/crap-login.jpg" title="ugly login screen" alt="ugly login screen" /></p>
<p>Gross. You could leave it like this for the time being and move on to other features if you so incline. I, however, can not do that anymore. Having a functioning app with a lame UI sounds as bad as having no app at all to me.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>At this point, it&#8217;s time to put a little shine on your application. If you&#8217;re not doing both design and development you could probably even &#8220;get lean&#8221; here and send a &#8220;card&#8221; downstream to a designer. Hmm, <code>article_ideas += 1</code>.</p>
<p>Anyway, now that we know we have a reliable test suite for this feature, start playing with the UI. With all the cool things available these days like <span class="caps">SASS</span>, Compass, Haml, etc. this step should be fast and easy, even without Photoshop.</p>
<p><img src="/public/images/taddd/nice-login.jpg" title="pretty login screen" alt="pretty login screen" /></p>
<p>So now you have a well tested, functional and quite attractive sign in feature. The cool thing about this approach is that it integrates really well with the normal red, green, refactor methodology. This won&#8217;t be the last sign in feature you write, most likely, so every new one is a chance to not only refactor your code, but also the design.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re a designer/developer hybrid or are tasked to doing both, try this out. It&#8217;s helped me get that abstract vision for things into a clearer light, which is always a good thing.</p>
