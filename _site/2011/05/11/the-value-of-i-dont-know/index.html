    <h1>The Value of I Don't Know</h1>
    <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; is one of the most powerful things you can say in my opinion. I don&#8217;t mean using it when you just don&#8217;t feel like talking, I mean when you truly do not understand something.</p>
<p>I think people feel weak or inferior when they don&#8217;t understand something and the rest of the group does. No one wants to be left out. It&#8217;s especially bad in an industry full of very smart people, solving very challenging problems, like we have in Software Development. You&#8217;re talking with your team of ten and every one is on the same page except you; it&#8217;s frightening!</p>
<p>Saying I don&#8217;t know is a true sign of strength though. Admitting to a group of people that you don&#8217;t understand something takes guts. It also takes brains. Wait, it takes brains to admit your brain doesn&#8217;t know something. That doesn&#8217;t make sense. <strong>Wrong sir!</strong></p>
<p><img src="/public/images/wrong.jpg" title="Wrong sir" alt="Wrong sir" /></p>
<p>It makes perfect sense. When you admit you don&#8217;t know something to a group of people, you&#8217;re essentially making an informal pact with them to figure it out. You&#8217;re also not feeding them false information, which is always a good thing. Unless your a double-agent.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is, don&#8217;t be afraid to admit you don&#8217;t know something. Some people may come down on you for it, but fuck them. Be honest, be sincere and acknowledge when you have something to learn. That&#8217;s how you improve, right?</p>
