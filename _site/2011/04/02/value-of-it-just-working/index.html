    <h1>Taking Care of Business</h1>
    <p>One of the many things I love about the Ruby community is the notion that things should &#8220;just work&#8221; out of the box. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s in part due to Rails&#8217; convention over configuration mentality, but I think it&#8217;s more than that.</p>
<p>During the day I wear skin tight, rockstar style snake skin pants. If you aren&#8217;t picking up on my odd, far-reaching metaphor, I mean I write Python code. Anyway, it may just be a lack of experience in the community but things seem infinitely more complicated to get up and running than when I&#8217;m working with Ruby. It just feels like there is more between me and the end goal.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a few of my favorite pieces of &#8220;just works&#8221; Ruby software:</p>
<h3>Devise</h3>
<p><code>rails g devise:install</code> and <code>rails g devise user</code> Done. You&#8217;ve got a sign in page, a user model, migration and all the goodness. I just wrote the steps for adding authentication to an app in a single sentence. That&#8217;s incredible.</p>
<h3>Heroku</h3>
<p>Heroku is another great example that literally takes seconds to get up and running with. <code>rails new blog</code>, <code>heroku create</code>, <code>git push heroku master</code>. Done &amp; done. Application deployed and online.</p>
<h3>Rubygems</h3>
<p>So you have a gem you want to make available to the world? Simple, <code>gem build whatever.gemspec</code> and <code>gem push whatever-0.0.1.gem</code>. Done. Granted, I do know this one has a Python equivalent. <code>python setup.py register</code> claims to get you the same, but my recent attempts have all failed with, &#8220;You are not allowed to store &#8216;whatever&#8217; package information&#8221;. Okay.. so.. what now?</p>
<p>Tools are an important part of any developers day to day life. I think tools are partially why Ruby developers are typically quite productive. We see the value in good development tools and we spend time crafting them to &#8220;just work&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is only one of the many things I admire about the Ruby community, but it&#8217;s an important one. Having efficient tools helps make an efficient developer.</p>
