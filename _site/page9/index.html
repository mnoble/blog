    <h2>A Developer's Introduction to Puppet</h2>
    <p><img src="/public/images/sock-puppet.jpg" class="right" title="Puppet" alt="Puppet" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com/puppet/introduction/">Puppet</a> is one of those things most Rubyists have probably heard of, but few know very well. I&#8217;ve recently started using it in conjunction with Vagrant and found myself wanting a consolidated explanation of it&#8217;s components. So, here it is!</p>
<h3>Nodes</h3>
<p>A node represents a specific type of machine. It defines how, and with what, that type of server gets provisioned. Examples nodes would be like a web server, a mail server or an <span class="caps">LDAP</span> server.</p>
<h3>Modules</h3>
<p>Puppet modules are much like Ruby modules. They&#8217;re an organization tool which DRYs up your Puppet configs. Modules contain Classes, Templates, Files, etc. The Puppet site explains it well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modules are reusable, sharable units of Puppet code. They can automate tasks such as setting up a database, web server, or mail server.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Classes</h3>
<p>Classes are the actual unit you can include into <em>nodes</em> or even other classes. Classes support a simplified type of inheritance. Say you want to use nginx as a web server one place, but as a proxy another. You&#8217;d have a base class, <code>nginx</code>, then a <code>nginx::proxy</code> class which modifies the base to act as a proxy server.</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>Resources are what classes contain. They&#8217;re a single item that is part of the overall configuration of a class. Take our <code>nginx</code> example above, to provision nginx on a machine we need a couple things. We need to ensure the package is installed, we want to make sure the service is running and we&#8217;d like to define a custom <code>nginx.conf</code>. These would all be resource definitions.</p>
<h3>Templates</h3>
<p>Templates are any file you want to put on the machine being provisioned. This can range from a <code>nginx.conf</code> file to <code>/etc/hosts</code>. You can include dynamic data by specifying class variables in your.. you guessed it, classes! These files are just <em>erb</em> so any normal Ruby goes.</p>
<h3>Just the Surface</h3>
<p>This is a very, very basic overview of Puppet. It&#8217;s an extremely powerful platform that can really make your life easier. I didn&#8217;t cover any examples of the Puppet <span class="caps">DSL</span> on purpose, I want this to just be a basic primer to Puppet&#8217;s concepts.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/">Puppet Labs&#8217; Documentation</a> for more information. Also, take a look into their <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/">Module Forge</a> for preexisting modules you can use right now, with barely any work.</p>
