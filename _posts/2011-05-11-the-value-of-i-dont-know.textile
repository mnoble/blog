title: The Value of I Don't Know

"I don't know" is one of the most powerful things you can say in my opinion. I don't mean using it when you just don't feel like talking, I mean when you truly do not understand something.

I think people feel weak or inferior when they don't understand something and the rest of the group does. No one wants to be left out. It's especially bad in an industry full of very smart people, solving very challenging problems, like we have in Software Development. You're talking with your team of ten and every one is on the same page except you; it's frightening!

Saying I don't know is a true sign of strength though. Admitting to a group of people that you don't understand something takes guts. It also takes brains. Wait, it takes brains to admit your brain doesn't know something. That doesn't make sense. *Wrong sir!*

It makes perfect sense. When you admit you don't know something to a group of people, you're essentially making an informal pact with them to figure it out. You're also not feeding them false information, which is always a good thing. Unless your a double-agent.

Anyway, the point is, don't be afraid to admit you don't know something. Some people may come down on you for it, but fuck them. Be honest, be sincere and acknowledge when you have something to learn. That's how you improve, right?
