title: CSSTree - An ultra-simple CSS parser
date: 2011-08-20

I needed something to parse a bunch of CSS and gave me a manipulatable object. I tried a couple parsers and none of them worked. It wasn't that they didn't do everything I needed, they just flat out didn't work at all.

So then I made "CSSTree":https://github.com/mnoble/csstree. It's dead-simple and does next to nothing. Other than parsing CSS that is.

{% highlight ruby %}
tree = CSSTree.parse("body { color: #000000; }")
# => #<CSSTree:0x000000>
tree.find("body").color
# => "#000000"
tree.find("body").margin = "10px" 
# => "10px"
tree.render
# => "body { color: #000000; margin: 10px; }
{% endhighlight %}

And that's pretty much it. Go team!
